# Product Boundaries (v0)

## What this product is not (right now)

- Not a fully automated life manager
- Not a replacement for professional finance tools
- Not a system that makes irreversible decisions for the user
- Not optimized for power users in v0

## What we are intentionally postponing

- Heavy automation and AI agents
- Deep analytics and insights
- Cross-platform complexity

## Why these boundaries exist
We want to validate core usefulness and trust before increasing complexity.
